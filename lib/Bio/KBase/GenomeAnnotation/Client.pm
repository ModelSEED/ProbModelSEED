=item Description

Given a genome typed object, find instances of ribosomal RNAs in
the genome.
The types parameter is used to select the types of RNAs to
call. It is a list of strings where each value is one of
   "5S"
   "SSU"
   "LSU"
or "ALL" to choose all available rRNA types.

                the strand
                the length

           We often speak of "a region".  By "location", we mean a sequence
           of regions from the same genome (perhaps from distinct contigs).

           Strand is either '+' or '-'.
