        FullObjectPath - full path to object in workspace, including object name
        Timestamp creation_time - time when the object was created
        ObjectID - a globally unique UUID assigned to every object that will never change even if the object is moved
        Username object_owner - name of object owner
        ObjectSize - size of the object in bytes or if object is directory, the number of objects in directory
        UserMetadata - arbitrary user metadata associated with object
        AutoMetadata - automatically populated metadata generated from object data in automated way
        WorkspacePerm user_permission - permissions for the authenticated user of this workspace.
